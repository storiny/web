We appreciate your trust in Storiny ("Storiny", "we", "us", or "our") to handle your data. Our Privacy Statement outlines how we handle your data, including any personal data we collect and process in connection with our website and any applications, software, products, and services we offer (collectively, the "Services").

> **Summary:** We take user privacy seriously. Our commitment to respecting user privacy is central to our mission. We do not engage in the sale of personal information, and we collect only the information necessary to create and maintain your account, provide services, meet our user commitments, and comply with legal requirements. We use certain information to identify and prevent violations of our Community Guidelines and the distribution of harmful content through our services. You have control over your privacy on Storiny.

Your use or access of the Websites and Services indicates your acceptance of the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy. Failure to agree with this Privacy Policy prohibits your access or use of our Service, or participation in our Services.

## 1. Collection of Information

The nature of the personal data we collect is subject to change upon your engagement with us, your service preferences, and your decisions.

### 1.4 Information we collect from third-parties

In instances where you register or log in to your Storiny account through a third-party platform such as Apple or Google, we may access specific information from these platforms such as your full name, e-mail address, profile picture, and biography.

Moreover, we may share all the personal data categories stated above with the third-party types described below for the following business objectives:

- We facilitate the sharing of personal information with other users of our Services transparently and responsibly.

Additionally, we may also share information about your activities on our Services, including your followers and whom you follow, your friends, recent posts, and comments. We are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of your personal information, and we provide you with the necessary tools and controls to manage the information you share on our Services
- We engage with service providers to process personal data on our behalf to deliver or enhance our services. These service providers perform various tasks such as payment processing, network data transmission, web analytics, marketing operations, and security.

It is important to note that our Service includes integrations, references, or links to services provided by third parties. If you provide personal data to any of those third parties or allow us to share personal data with them, that data will be governed by their own privacy statements.

### 3.1 Third-party embeds

Storiny is not responsible for hosting certain content that appears on our Services. Users have the option to include content that is hosted by a third party but is embedded within their stories (an "Embed"). Whenever you interact with an Embed, it can send information regarding your interaction to the hosting third party, much like if you were to visit the third party's site directly.

Storiny lacks control over the data that third parties acquire through Embeds, or how they use it. Consequently, this Privacy Policy does not apply to data gathered via Embeds. The privacy policy of the third party that hosts the Embed applies to any data that the Embed collects, and we suggest that you evaluate that policy before interacting with the Embed.

## 4. Your data processing choices

We offer you the freedom to choose how we process your personal information.

Access, correction, and deletion of your basic user profile information are available to you as a Storiny user. You can make changes to your user profile or reach out to Storiny Support for assistance. You may control the information we collect by managing your profile, keeping your details current, modifying your cookie preferences, or contacting our [support team](mailto:support@storiny.com).

To obtain a comprehensive record of your account activity, you can initiate the data export process by navigating to your [account settings page](/me/account/privacy) and saving a local copy. It's important to note that certain components of the exported data are in a proprietary format, which may require the use of our services to access.

Your data will be retained and used according to the Privacy Statement, but we will remove your complete profile within 90 days of your request unless legally required to do otherwise.

If we process personal data beyond your profile information or information from third parties, you may access, modify, delete, object to, or limit the processing of your data by contacting Storiny Support, subject to applicable laws.

To enhance your privacy on our platform, we provide the option to make your profile private. By selecting this option, your public data will only be visible to your approved friends.

If you cannot access certain personal data through the means listed above, you may request access by contacting us via the contact information provided at the bottom of this Privacy Statement.

## 5. Communication preferences

In compliance with our Privacy Policy, we utilize your email address solely for communication purposes that you have granted us permission for. This includes responding to any requests made to our Support team via email. It is important to note that your email address is treated with the utmost confidentiality and is not shared with other users, even if you have subscribed to their newsletter. Additionally, we strictly prohibit any attempts to access or export the email addresses of individuals who have subscribed to newsletters.

Storiny may periodically send notification emails, including updates on new features, feedback requests, policy changes, or customer support initiatives, depending on your [email settings](/me/account/notifications). We may also send promotional emails under applicable laws and regulations, based on the preferences you have specified.

## 6. Cookies and tracking technologies

Storiny utilizes cookies and similar technologies to facilitate and enhance the user experience, as well as to develop new features and functionality of the Service. These cookies enable Storiny to:

- keep users logged in;
- remember their preferences;
- identify their devices for security purposes, including as necessary to maintain the integrity of the Service;
- generate statistical reports;
- provide information and insight for future development of the platform.

Emails sent by Storiny to users may contain a pixel tag, a small, clear image that enables Storiny to determine if an email has been opened and what the recipient's IP address is. Storiny uses this pixel tag to enhance the effectiveness of email communications and ensure that unwanted emails are not sent.

The duration for which cookies remain on a browser or device varies based on whether they are "persistent" or "session" cookies. Session cookies usually expire once browsing is halted, while persistent cookies remain until they expire or are deleted. The expiration date or retention period of persistent cookies depends on the purpose of the cookie collection and the tool used.

### 6.1 What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files stored on a device by a browser, which can later be read when the browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. These cookies can contain a unique string of numbers and letters that can identify the device and other relevant information.

Web beacons, also known as "single-pixel" or "clear GIFs," are electronic images contained within a website or email that allow the web server hosting the image to log device information and set and read its cookies. Similarly, third-party content on Storiny's website, such as embedded videos, or plug-ins, may cause the browser to connect to the third-party web server hosting that content.

Storiny uses cookies and similar technologies for a range of purposes, including storing user preferences and settings, enabling sign-in functionality, analyzing Service performance, tracking user interaction with the Service, generating inferences, combatting fraud, and fulfilling other legitimate purposes. Some of these cookies and technologies may be provided by third parties, including service providers. Analytics partners may collect personal information, including pages visited, links clicked, usage information, identifiers, and device information.

Information collected or inferred through the use of cookies and similar technologies may be shared with third parties for these purposes.

Below is a list that furnishes further details on the various types of cookies we use and their respective purposes:

- **Required Cookies:** Storiny employs essential cookies to carry out fundamental website functions and offer its services. Such cookies serve various purposes, such as facilitating login, optimizing performance, routing traffic between web servers, detecting screen size, measuring page load times, enhancing user experience, and performing audience measurement. These cookies are vital for the proper functioning of our websites.

- **Analytics:** To enhance our website performance and improve your experience, we authorize third-party entities to employ analytics cookies. These cookies are utilized to collect information regarding your browsing activities, such as the pages you visit and the number of clicks required to complete a specific task.

## 7. Retention of personal data

To fulfill our obligations to you and comply with legal requirements, we retain personal data only for as long as necessary. This includes providing the services you have requested, completing transactions, resolving disputes, enforcing agreements, and pursuing other legitimate and lawful business purposes. The actual length of time we retain data can vary based on factors such as user consent, the sensitivity of the data, user expectations, the availability of automated controls to delete data, and legal or contractual obligations. For instance, to ensure the security of your data, we may retain it for longer periods, as required by applicable law.

## 8. Security of your data

Storiny takes strict measures to safeguard your data against unauthorized access, modification, or destruction, ensuring its accuracy and proper use. To strengthen this protection, we recommend using a robust password and refraining from sharing it with others or reusing it across different platforms or accounts.
