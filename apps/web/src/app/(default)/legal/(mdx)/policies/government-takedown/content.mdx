At times, we may receive requests from governmental authorities to remove content that has been deemed illegal in their particular jurisdiction. Although we may not necessarily endorse such laws, we may be required to block the content in question upon receipt of a formal request from a government official to ensure continued access to Storiny for our users within that jurisdiction.

## What does a complete government takedown request look like?

A comprehensive request or notice must fulfill the following criteria:

- It must be issued by an official government agency with jurisdiction over the matter
- It must identify the content that is deemed illegal
- It must specify the legal basis or court order that renders the content unlawful in the relevant jurisdiction

## Our Response to Takedown Requests

Upon receipt of a formal notice from a relevant and official government agency that identifies illegal content and specifies the source of the illegality, our protocol is to:

- Notify the users affected by the alleged violation of the law, specifying the content in question and indicating that this is a legal takedown request
- Provide the affected users with the opportunity to appeal the decision as part of the same notification
- Attempt to limit the geographic scope of the takedown request where possible, and disclose such limitations as part of the notification
