We might get appeals from government authorities to take down material that they consider unlawful in their specific region. Even if we don't necessarily support these regulations, we could be obligated to restrict the mentioned content when we receive an official request from a government representative. This action aims to ensure that our users in that area can still access Storiny without any interruption.

## What does a complete government takedown request look like?

A comprehensive request or notice must fulfill the following criteria:

- It must be issued by an official government agency with jurisdiction over the matter
- It must identify the content that is deemed illegal
- It must specify the legal basis or court order that renders the content unlawful in the relevant jurisdiction

## Our Response to Takedown Requests

Upon receipt of a formal notice from a relevant and official government agency that identifies illegal content and specifies the source of the illegality, our protocol is to:

- Notify the users affected by the alleged violation of the law, specifying the content in question and indicating that this is a legal takedown request
- Provide the affected users with the opportunity to appeal the decision as part of the same notification
- Attempt to limit the geographic scope of the takedown request where possible, and disclose such limitations as part of the notification
