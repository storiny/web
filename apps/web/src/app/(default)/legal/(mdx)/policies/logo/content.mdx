In certain circumstances, it is permissible to incorporate Storiny logos into your website or third-party application. To obtain detailed information and specific guidelines regarding logo usage, we recommend referring to the [Storiny Logos and Usage page](/branding).

Additionally, you have the option to utilize the Storiny logo on your website to link to your Storiny account. However, it is important to note that the Storiny logo should not be used to represent your company or a product you are developing.
