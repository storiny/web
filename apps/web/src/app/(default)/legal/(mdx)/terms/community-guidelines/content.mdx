Storiny is more than just a platform—it's a community where your stories are welcomed and cherished. It's a place where you can share your experiences, thoughts, and ideas with like-minded individuals who share your passion for storytelling. These Community Guidelines are put in place to ensure that all individuals can freely express themselves and engage with others in a community setting, without infringing upon the rights of others. It is important to note that such expression should not come at the expense of any other individual or group.

These guidelines provide a breif overview of what behaviors and content are considered inappropriate and thus not allowed on the platform. All users of the platform must adhere to these guidelines, which apply to all areas of the platform, including but not limited to content, behaviors, and applications.

At the core of Storiny lies the commitment to maintaining a safe and secure environment for all users. We take a proactive approach to monitoring and reviewing user-generated content.

In the event of a violation of our guidelines, we reserve the right to take swift and appropriate action, including but not limited to issuing warnings, removal of content, termination of offending accounts, and, if deemed necessary, reporting the matter to the relevant law enforcement authorities.

As part of Storiny's collective responsibility to ensure a safe and enjoyable user experience, we strongly encourage users who come across stories, accounts, comments, replies, or any other content that appear to be in breach of our guidelines, to report such instances to us. By doing so, we can work together to safeguard the well-being of our community and maintain the integrity of Storiny.

## Your responsibility as a user

As a platform for sharing ideas, Storiny upholds strict guidelines to ensure that all users can enjoy a safe and respectful environment. To that end, we expect all users to abide by the following rules:

- **Harassment:** Storiny has a zero-tolerance policy towards harassment, including sustained bullying, or ban or block evasion. Additionally, any form of sexual harassment, such as posting unrequested sexually suggestive content, unwanted sexualization, or linking to, or promoting pornographic images or videos is not allowed. However, the platform permits the sharing of erotic writing and non-graphic erotic images, as long as they have been rated as containing suggestive nudity and do not violate any other policies. Storiny also has a strict stance against the sharing of unjustified graphic or disturbing media, irrespective of the subject
- **Discrimination and hate speech:** We do not tolerate any discriminatory speech or hostile behavior, including the use of hate symbols and claims that deny the history of mass human cruelty. Hate speech is any form of expression that attacks other people or promotes hatred or violence against them based on their protected characteristics
- **Threats:** Storiny has a zero-tolerance policy towards direct or indirect threats of physical harm to individuals or groups, including direct, indirect, and suggestive threats. We take such threats seriously and will take appropriate action, including but not limited to account termination, and reporting to law enforcement if necessary
- **Violent extremism:** We do not permit the organizing, endorsing, or fostering of violent extremism, including glorifying violent events or the perpetrators of violent acts, as well as promoting conspiracy theories that could encourage or incite violence against others
- **Child sexual abuse:** Sharing child sexual abuse content or content that sexualizes children in any way, including real and manipulated media, animation, and any type of digital creation, is strictly prohibited on our platform. Storiny takes a strong stance against child sexual abuse and grooming and reports any instances of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and grooming to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children
- **Grooming:** We do not allow any sexual conduct or solicitation of sexual content, including "grooming," with individuals under 18 years old. As with CSAM, Storiny reports instances of grooming to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children
- **Age restriction:** All sexually explicit content or any other content shared solely for sexual gratification must be age-restricted by marking it as explicit. Additionally, you must be 18 years of age or older (or meet the minimum age requirement set by your local laws) to publish or read adult stories on Storiny
- **Inappropriate content sharing:** Do not share or use sexually explicit content in user avatars, bios, profile banners, story splashes, or any other space that cannot be age-restricted. This applies to all users, regardless of age

## Your responsibility for the content you share

- Abstain from spreading any kind of false or misleading information on Storiny. We do not disregard the distribution of content that is erroneous, deceptive, or could potentially cause physical or societal harm. In such cases, we reserve the right to remove the content if we reasonably believe that its circulation could result in harm to physical infrastructure, injury to individuals, obstruction of participation in civic processes, or endangerment of public health
- We strictly prohibit the act of spreading repetitive iterations of identical content, whether originating from a single account or distributed via multiple accounts, be it in the public domain or the form of an unlisted story. Notwithstanding, you are permitted to share content from your blog with Storiny, so long as you hold the proprietary rights to the said content
- Do not assume a deceitful or harmful identity on Storiny. This encompasses the creation of counterfeit profiles and efforts to impersonate an individual, group, or organization
- Refrain from engaging in any activities that may risk or undermine the security of an account, network, or system. This includes utilizing deceptive strategies to force others into disclosing sensitive information (phishing), utilizing malicious software (malware), and overwhelming a target with traffic to prevent access to a resource (DoS attacks)
- Abstain from using or attempting to use Storiny to promote, coordinate, or carry out financial scams. Any deliberately deceptive actions carried out to acquire an illegal, unethical, or otherwise dishonest gain are not permitted
- Do not engage in activities that generate a profit at the expense of others through fraudulent means. This includes facilitating, providing instructions for, or participating in fraud

### Embedded content

To ensure the utmost level of data privacy and security for our valued users, all embedded content must meet the following stringent requirements. An "embed" may consist of a link, form, or request for information or other content.

- Under no circumstances shall embeds that directly collect data through form fields or other onsite means be permissible
- When linking to external forms from your Storiny post, the form must clearly state that the user is leaving Storiny and is subject to third-party terms. Disclose if a link takes users to your site. Forms must disclose if user information will be sent offsite

## Respect our site and services

Storiny's policy strictly prohibits any form of spamming or misuse of its services, and we take immediate action to remove any such occurrences. The following practices are considered examples of spam and misuse that are strictly not allowed on Storiny:

- Creation of new accounts or the use of existing ones following the issuance of termination or removal for violation of Storiny's community guidelines
- Posting duplicate content or content generated solely by AI, regardless of the accounts involved, or repetition of the same content
- Posting content with the sole aim of driving traffic or enhancing the search rankings of external sites, products, or services
- Utilizing self-bots that exert a burden on Storiny's infrastructure and undermine our capacity to provide our services
- Scraping and reposting of content obtained from other sources
- Engaging in an unreasonably large number of interactions, especially through automated means
- Repetitive utilization of comments or other interactions for promotional or marketing objectives

If you observe any activity that violates our policies, including these guidelines and our [Terms of Service](/legal/terms/tos), please report it to us by sending an email to [support@storiny.com](mailto:support@storiny.com). It is important to note that we strongly discourage fake or incomplete reports, as this could potentially cause harm to individuals and could also interfere with our investigations, affecting our ability to report to law enforcement.

As these guidelines continue to evolve, we reserve the right to take action against users or content that violate the purpose of these guidelines when a new danger or harm emerges that is not explicitly addressed in the current version.

We will make every effort to keep you informed of any updates to these guidelines.
