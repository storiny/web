It is important to note that the content remains your responsibility and we reserve the right to remove it without prior notice.

As a user of Storiny, you retain ownership of the content you add to our service. However, to provide the service effectively, we require limited rights to display and share your content. You are solely responsible for your content and any consequences that may result from it. Under applicable legal requirements and to operate and improve our services, we are granted a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to your content, excluding certain intellectual property rights that we do not own. These rights include:

Storing, using, copying, publishing, parsing, and displaying your content across the Service, provided you choose to make it publicly accessible. For instance, your public stories may appear in select users' home feeds. Modifying, translating, and adapting your content. For example, we may resize images in your stories to fit smaller screen sizes or display a preview of your content (with attribution).
Sublicensing your content to enable our services to operate as intended. This allows us to store your content in our cloud service providers' data centers. Creating derivative works and reproducing your content. For example, we may perform database backups, extract some or all portions of your content into a search index, and produce different sizes of uploaded images such as thumbnails.
We take your privacy seriously and never sell or distribute your content outside Storiny without your permission, nor does this license grant us such provisions. However, we reserve the right to remove any content that violates any laws or Storiny's policies.

We value your feedback and always welcome it. When you provide us with feedback, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide, sublicensable, perpetual, irrevocable, and transferable license to use, copy, adapt, modify, and exploit the feedback without restriction, attribution, or compensation.
