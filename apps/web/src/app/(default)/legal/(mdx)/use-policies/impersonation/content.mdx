Misrepresenting your identity or association with others is strictly prohibited. This includes engaging in any of the following activities in a manner that misleads or deceives others:

- Using someone else's avatar or personal profile information without permission
- Posting content under another user's email address
- Adopting a username that is deceptively similar to someone else's
- Accessing an account using another user's credentials
- Pretending to be another individual

Impersonation constitutes harassment, and violation of this policy may result in the loss of access to your account.

It's important to note that having a username similar to another user's does not necessarily amount to impersonation. Storiny considers the context of the situation. For instance, cases involving claims of misinformation or disinformation typically allow for parody and satire as long as they adhere to our [Acceptable Use Policies](/legal/use-policies/general).
