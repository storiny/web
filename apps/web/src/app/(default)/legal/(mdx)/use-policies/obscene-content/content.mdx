Content associated with sexual exploitation or abuse of another individual, especially involving minors, is strictly prohibited. We do not permit sexually themed or suggestive content that serves no meaningful purpose other than to evoke an erotic or shocking response, especially when it is prominently displayed in profiles or other social contexts. Examples of such content include:

- Pornographic material
- Non-consensual intimate imagery
- Graphic depictions of sexual acts, including photographs, videos, animations, drawings, computer-generated images, or text-based content

We acknowledge that not all nudity or sexuality-related content is obscene, and we do allow various forms of erotic writing. Visual and/or textual depictions in artistic, educational, historical, journalistic, or victim advocacy contexts may be allowed. In some cases, including a disclaimer can help provide the necessary context for a story. However, please note that we may restrict access to such content by giving users the option to opt in before viewing it.
