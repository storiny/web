We have a zero-tolerance policy for harassment, bullying, and any form of abuse on our platform. This includes:

- Engaging in targeted personal attacks
- Arranging disruptive activity or piling on in a manner that amounts to abuse
- Intimidating others by following them around the platform
- Making inappropriate sexual advances or comments towards individuals
- Participating in discussions with deceitful intent to provoke conflict or undermine genuine conversation
- Creating alternate accounts to evade moderation actions by Storiny staff or other users

Please note that not all unwelcome conduct is considered harassment. Disagreements of comments may not necessarily qualify as harassment. Criticism of public figures, projects, or topics of public interest may also be acceptable, but we encourage users to be mindful of their engagement to avoid disrupting the experience of others.
