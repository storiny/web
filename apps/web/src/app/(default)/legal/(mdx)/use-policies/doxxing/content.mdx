Posting other people's personal information is strictly prohibited. This includes:

- Personal email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Physical addresses or private location information
- Bank account details or credit card numbers
- Social Security/National Identity numbers
- Passwords
- Voter information
- Medical information and personal biometric data
- Other private information that may jeopardize safety or security

We may also consider the unauthorized distribution of photos or videos without the subject's consent as an invasion of privacy, especially if it poses a safety risk, such as in cases of intimidation or harassment.

When assessing reports, we take into account the context and whether the information is publicly available elsewhere. However, please note that sharing publicly available content may still violate our bullying and harassment policy if it is done with the intention to harass or incite abusive behavior.
