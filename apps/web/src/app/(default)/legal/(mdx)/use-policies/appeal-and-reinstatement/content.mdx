While the majority of interactions on Storiny align with our [Acceptable Use Policies](/legal/use-policies/general) and [Community Guidelines](/legal/terms/community-guidelines), violations do occur from time to time. In such cases, Storiny staff may take enforcement actions to address the violations. However, we also recognize that there may be circumstances where a moderation action taken by Storiny staff needs to be reconsidered.

## What are appeals and reinstatements?

**Reinstatement:** Users who wish to regain access to their account or content can request reinstatement. They must be willing to make the necessary changes to address the violation and commit to complying with our terms in the future.

**Appeal:** Users who disagree with a violation decision can appeal and provide additional information to support their case, demonstrating that a different decision should have been reached.

## How it works:

To request reinstatement or appeal an enforcement action, please [contact support](/support).

Storiny staff will review the information provided to assess whether sufficient grounds exist for reinstatement or an appeal.

- **Reinstatement:** If a user agrees to abide by our Acceptable Use Policies going forward and has addressed the violation(s), we may reinstate their account or content based on the circumstances and severity of the initial violation. All legitimate reinstatement requests will receive an initial review and a decision.
- **Appeal:** If a user disputes a decision, they can use the support channel to explain their grounds for disagreement and provide additional information related to the alleged violation. If the provided information demonstrates that a different conclusion should have been reached, we may grant the appeal. If the initial reviewer of the appeal is the same person who made the original decision and believes their decision was correct, another Storiny staff member will independently review the appeal. All legitimate appeals will receive a final decision.
