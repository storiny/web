Storiny maintains a strict stance against speech that targets or promotes hate towards individuals or groups based on their personal attributes, including age, body size, ability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity, or sexual orientation. This includes:

- Ridiculing, attacking, or excluding individuals or groups based on the aforementioned characteristics
- Displaying clear affiliation or identification with known terrorist or violent extremist organizations
- Supporting or promoting hate groups or hate-based conspiracy theories
- Sharing symbols or images associated with hate
- Using harmful stereotypes, slurs, or dehumanizing language
- Targeting individuals based on perceived gender
- Engaging in dog whistling, which involves using coded or suggestive language and/or symbols to promote abuse or hate

Storiny is committed to addressing all forms of abuse and harassment on our platform. We place particular emphasis on combating hate-based abuse that disproportionately affects historically targeted communities. Our goal is to create a welcoming and safe environment for all individuals on Storiny.
