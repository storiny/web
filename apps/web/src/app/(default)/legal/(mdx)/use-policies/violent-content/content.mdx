The promotion or incitement of violence is strictly prohibited on Storiny. Posting content that depicts or glorifies violence or physical harm towards humans or animals is also not allowed. This includes:

- Threatening others with abuse, harm, sexual violence, or death
- Sharing text, images, or audio content that glorifies or graphically depicts violence against individuals, groups, or animals
- Encouraging self-harm or harm to others

We do not allow the uncritical posting of violent content or its use in ways that make it difficult for other users to avoid, such as through profile avatars, profile banners, or comments. However, we recognize that there may be valid reasons for sharing violent content, such as educational or documentary purposes, creative works, or depictions of historical events. In such cases, providing a clear warning or disclaimer allows users to make an informed decision about engaging with the content. Nonetheless, Storiny may choose to limit the visibility of such content to those who choose to opt in.
