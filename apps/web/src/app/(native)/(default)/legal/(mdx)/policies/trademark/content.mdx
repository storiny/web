## What constitutes a violation of the Storiny Trademark Policy?

Employing a company or business name, logo, or any other trademark-protected materials in a manner that may mislead or confuse individuals concerning its brand or business affiliation may be deemed a violation of the trademark policy.

## What does not constitute a violation of the Storiny Trademark Policy?

Employing a trademark belonging to another party in a manner unrelated to the product or service for which the trademark was originally granted does not infringe upon the trademark policy. Furthermore, the existence of a Storiny account utilizing a username identical to a registered trademark does not, in and of itself, necessarily constitute a violation of our trademark policy.

## How Storiny Responds to Reports of trademark policy violations

Upon receipt of reports of trademark policy violations from proprietors of federal or international trademark registrations, Storiny undertakes an account review, and may proceed with the following courses of action:

- In instances where there is an unambiguous intent to deceive the public through the unapproved usage of a trademark, Storiny reserves the right to suspend the account and provide notice to the account holder
- When it is determined that an account has the potential to confuse users, although not intentionally representing itself as the trademarked product or service, we offer the account holder an opportunity to address any potential ambiguities. Additionally, we may hand over a username for the trademark holder's immediate usage
